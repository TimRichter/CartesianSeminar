* Code scratchpad for Cartesian seminar October 2022 
We read Gibbons "A pointless derivation of radix sort"
** Session October 18th
*** pointfree (pointless) calculation:
defined in the abstract as calculations on the level of function composition
instead of at the level of function application
*** Nicola: give an example for a "calculation"

#+begin_src agda2
module Gibbons where

data ℕ : Set where
  Zero : ℕ
  Succ : ℕ → ℕ

{-# BUILTIN NATURAL ℕ #-}

id : ℕ → ℕ
id n = n

infixr 10 _+_
infixr 20 _*_

_+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
Zero + b = b
Succ a + b = Succ (a + b)

_*_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ   
Zero * b = Zero
Succ a * b = b + a * b

-- Note! : function application by juxtaposition
-- (the argument isn't put in parentheses) 
double : ℕ → ℕ
double n = 2 * n

quadruple : ℕ → ℕ
quadruple n = 4 * n

quadruple' : ℕ → ℕ
quadruple' n = double (double n)

-- goal: define quadruple "pointfree", i.e. without mentioning the argument,
--       this would be
--  quadruple = double ∘ double
--       where the ∘ denotes function composition.
--       So let's define this:

infix 10 _∘_

_∘_ : {!!} 

#+end_src agda2
*** TODO Explain difference between A → (B → C), (A → B) → C, A×B → C !
*** TODO give the type of function composition !
